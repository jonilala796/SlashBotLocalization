# SlashBotLocalization
The localized strings of SlashBot

### How to add a new language:
- Grab the en.json and TEMPLATE.json files
- Fill out the TEMPLATE.json file with the translations translated from en.json
- Rename the TEMPLATE.json file to the language code you translated to
(for german that would be de.json)
- Create a Pull request using the pull request template and add the translated file
- Wait for approval

### How to edit already existing languages:
- Grab the language file you want to edit
- Edit the strings
- Create a pull request using the pull request template
- Wait for approval

## FILES WHICH YOU CAN'T CREATE PULL REQUESTS FOR
- TEMPLATE.json
- en.json
- AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES.json
- pull_request_template.md

These are the "template" files we use to add new languages since the bot is originally written in english and then translated to other languages
